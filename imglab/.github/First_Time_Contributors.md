# Welcome

Welcome to the world of open source developement. I hope this guideline can help you to contribute in opensource development.

## About
Imglab is the web based interactive tool for image labeling. You can mark an object and it's featurepoint. You can save all labelled information and feed it to other libraries which can help you to detect objects or create models for other machine learning softwares or object detectors.

Technically, this project is completely developed with the help of jQuery. However, my plan is to make it a react project in future.

Feel free to update this guide, raise an issue or tweet me.

**Please note that**

* **Don't stretch**. If you complete an issue in long time, there is a possibility that other developers finish their part and you face code conflicts which may increase code complexity for you. So it is always good to complete an issue ASAP. 
* Ask and help your friends and colleagues to attempt other issues instead of working on multiple issues together.
* Please claim the issue and clear your doubts before raising PR. So other users will not start working on the same issue.
* Mention the issue number either in PR detail or in commit message.
* Keep increasing the level of challenge.
