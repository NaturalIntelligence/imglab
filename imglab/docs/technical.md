## Code overview

### Global variables

* tools : (config.js) It contains the detail of all the tools which should be displayed on toolbar
* labellingData : An object where each key is the name of image loaded into thumbnail slider.
* imgSelected : An object selected image containes it's name, and size detail.

* pluginsStore : contains data for plugin
* myCanvas : svg.js SVG object. It can be used to interact any SVG elements in workarea.
* data_schema : not in use yet. It'll be representing the schema of labellingData and will be used to store data in nimn format.
* appConfig : (settings.js) Contains app related settings to avoid hardcoding in the code.

### Global functions

* showSnackBar : use it to display some error message
* getCordinates : return mouse coordinates corresponding to SVG canvas.

### Files

* app.js : define global functions and variables here if they can't be logically grouped to particular js or tag file.
* store.js : to save shape information in labellingData variable.
* storePersistor.js : contains code to sync labellingData with browser cache

### Tag files
All the files inside tags folder are being used to display some UI component on the screen. We're using riot.js for the same. Files end with ".tag.html".

* actionbar.tag.html : Display the actions related to particular action bar.
* workarea.tag.html : To create / delete shapes in /from workarea and attach necessary events like select, resize, drag etc. When a shape is created / deleted, it updates labellingData by calling appropriate function in store.js
* toolbox.tag.html : Do appropriate action when a tool is selected.


### How to add actions for a tool

1. Create a tag file in `tags\actions\ folder. (Check sample files already present)

```html
<action-actionname>
</action-actionname>
```
2. Add a property `actions` against the tool in config.js. (You'll find some already)

```js
actions : [ 'actionname' ]
```
3. Include the tag file that you created in step 1, on v2.html .

### How to add a plugin

1. Add the entry in plugins variable in config.js
```js
var plugins = {
    "pluginname" : {
        title: "Some title to show on pluginwindow",
        tagName: 'plugintagname'
    }
}
```
2. If you need to save some data, it is recommanded to save in plugins store in config.js
```js
var pluginsStore = {
    "plugintagname" : {
      //plugin data
    }
}
```
3. Create a `plugintagname.tag.html` in `tags\plugins` folder
```html
<plugintagname>
</plugintagname>
```
